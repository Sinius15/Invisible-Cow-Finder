Invisible-Cow-Finder
====================

This Java application click all the pixels in a selected area to find an invisable cow!

This application uses two api's:

1.  Java Api Wrapper, found on http://www.aplu.ch/home/apluhomex.jsp?site=5
2.  XBoxController, found on http://www.aplu.ch/home/apluhomex.jsp?site=36

a huge shoutout to Dr. Aegidius Pl√ºss for creating the XBoxController api. This was my main enspiration for creating this little app.
